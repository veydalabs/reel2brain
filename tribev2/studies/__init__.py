"""Study registrations.

This module is imported for its side effects by ``tribev2.main``. Some local
development workflows re-run code in a long-lived Python process while clearing
only part of the module graph, which means the global ``neuralset`` study
registry may still contain old class objects from a previous run. Re-importing
the study modules would then raise a name-collision error even though the code
did not change.

To keep local reruns reliable, we clear only this package's known study names
before importing and then explicitly re-register the live class objects.
